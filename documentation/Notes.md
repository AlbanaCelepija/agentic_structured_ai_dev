--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Agent
In CrewAI, an Agent is defined as an autonomous entity that:

Has a Role—its function and expertise within the system, like a "Senior Technical Writer"
Has a Goal—its individual objective within the system, like "Craft a publication-ready article"
Has a Backstory—it provides context and personality to the agent, enriching interactions, like "You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest developments in AI. Known for your ability to find the most relevant information and present it in a clear and concise manner."

Moreover, an Agent can:

Use tools to accomplish the Goal.
Make decisions based on the Goal and the Role.
Collaborate with other agents.
Maintain memory of interactions.
Delegate tasks if needed (and if allowed to do so).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Task

In CrewAI, a Task is a specific assignment given to an AI agent. Tasks define what needs to be done, who is responsible, and how it should be executed, ensuring that agents can work efficiently, either independently or collaboratively.

A Task in CrewAI consists of:

A Clear Description – Defines the action an agent must complete.
An Assigned Agent – Specifies which agent is responsible.
Execution Strategy – Determines whether tasks run sequentially or hierarchically.
Dependencies (if any) – Defines whether a task requires input from another agent.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Team/ Crew

AI agents don’t work in isolation—they often need to collaborate with other agents to complete complex workflows.

That's why we create a Crew, which is a structured team of agents that work together to accomplish a goal. It orchestrates how tasks are assigned, executed, and passed between agents.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tools

While LLM-powered agents are great at reasoning and generating responses, they lack direct access to real-time information, external systems, and specialized computations.

Tools bridge this gap by allowing agents to:

Search the web for real-time data.
Retrieve structured information from APIs and databases.
Execute code to perform calculations or data transformations.
Analyze images, PDFs, and documents beyond just text inputs.
In short, tools empower AI agents to interact with the world, making them more dynamic, intelligent, and actionable.
