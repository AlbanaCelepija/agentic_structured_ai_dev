# AI-assisted strunctured and compliant AI development lifecycle

In this repo we propose a structured framework that enables the operationalisation of system-wide objectives throughout the various phases of the AI lifecycle, while systematically leveraging existing open source toolkits.
The framework implementation is based on AI agents that contribute to different planning and implementation aspects.
