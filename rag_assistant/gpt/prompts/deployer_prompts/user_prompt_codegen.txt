def bias_mitigation_pre_reweighing(data: Data, config: Configuration) -> Data:
    """Reweighing is a pre-processing bias mitigation technique that amends the dataset to achieve statistical parity. 
    This method adjusts the weights of the samples in the dataset to compensate for imbalances between 
    different groups. By applying appropriate weights to each instance, 
    it ensures that the model is not biased towards any particular group, thereby promoting fairness. 
    The goal is to adjust the influence of each group so that the final model satisfies fairness criteria 
    such as statistical parity or disparate impact."""
